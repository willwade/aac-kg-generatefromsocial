Great. Here’s a detailed, extensible plan for building a personal knowledge graph (KG) from social and life data (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook) in Markdown and triplet form — focused on enabling context-aware AAC for users with ASC or communication disabilities.

🧠 Personal Knowledge Graph for Context-Aware AAC

Purpose: Power real-time sentence suggestion, memory recall, and context-enhanced communication using structured life data.

📄 1. Unified Markdown Memory Format (editable by user or support person)

Filename Example:

person-memory.md

Markdown Schema Template:

# 📘 Personal Memory File – Will Wade

## 🧑 Identity
- Name: Will Wade
- Pronouns: he/him
- Lives in: Manchester, UK
- Works at: Open Assistive (Innovation & Research Manager)

## 👥 People
- Daisy: SLT, glasses, 2 children, co-authored Supercore
- Keith Vertanen: collaborator, MTU, TTS work
- Lisa: wife, Alice’s mum

## 🏢 Workplaces
- Open Assistive (2019–present)
- AT Charity (2015–2019)

## 💬 Events & Memories
- “AAC conference in Liverpool” → met Daisy, gave a talk
- “Barcelona July 2024” → with Lisa, attended concert
- “VoiceGarden launch” → partnered with SG Enable

## ❤️ Interests
- TTS, open hardware, biking, Sylvanian families with Alice

## 📚 Phrases I Often Say
- "That sounds like a plan."
- "Could we explore that idea a bit more?"
- "I worked on something similar with Keith…"

This file is:
	•	Editable by humans
	•	Ingestable by scripts
	•	Extendable for journaling, daily logs, or external feeds

🧩 2. Triplet-Based Graph Schema

Here’s a simplified but extensible entity-relationship structure for converting the Markdown to triplets.

🔹 Core Entities:

Type	Examples
Person	Will Wade, Daisy, Keith
Place	Manchester, Liverpool, Barcelona
Event	AAC Conference, Concert
Org	Open Assistive, MTU
Memory	“met Daisy at conference”
Phrase	“That sounds like a plan.”
Interest	“open hardware”, “biking”

🔹 Key Relations (Triplet Predicates):

Will_Wade --knows--> Daisy
Will_Wade --worksAt--> Open_Assistive
Daisy --hasRole--> SLT
Will_Wade --attendedEvent--> AAC_Conference_Liverpool_2023
AAC_Conference_Liverpool_2023 --happenedIn--> Liverpool
VoiceGarden --hasCollaborator--> Keith_Vertanen

Relations should follow a Verb-like predicate format, e.g.:
	•	knows, hasInterest, attendedEvent, saidPhrase, metAt, hasRole, isFamilyWith

Store as:
	•	RDF-style .ttl
	•	JSON triplet list
	•	SQLite or DuckDB table for embedded access

⸻

🔄 3. Ingestion Pipeline

✅ Inputs:
	•	memory.md
	•	LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. exports (.json, .csv)
	•	Optional: calendar, photo metadata, custom notes

🔧 Pipeline Stages:

Stage	Tool	Output
1. Parse Markdown	Python markdown-it or regex	Dictionary per section
2. Normalize	Custom schema map	JSON
3. Extract Triplets	Rule-based extractor (or LLM assist)	List of (Subject, Predicate, Object)
4. Store KG	NetworkX / RDFLib / SQLite	Queryable KG
5. Link Entities	Name resolver / fuzzy match	Canonical graph
6. Serve to LLM	RAG store / prompt injection	Chat-ready memory context


⸻

🔄 Example Pipeline Execution (Prototype)

Given this:

- Daisy: SLT, glasses, 2 children, co-authored Supercore

Output:

[
  ["Will_Wade", "knows", "Daisy"],
  ["Daisy", "hasRole", "SLT"],
  ["Daisy", "wears", "glasses"],
  ["Daisy", "hasChildren", "2"],
  ["Daisy", "coauthored", "Supercore"]
]


⸻

🧠 LLM Usage Pattern (for AAC)
	1.	Query Layer: When Daisy is mentioned in speech, look up:
	•	Role
	•	Relationship to user
	•	Past events involving her
	2.	Sentence Prompting Template:
“Would you like me to message Daisy, your SLT colleague from Liverpool?”
	3.	Stylistic Expansion:
	•	Style embeddings or lookup (“phrases I often use”)
	•	Time-based suggestions (e.g. “You often see Daisy on Thursdays”)

⸻

🚀 Extensibility Plan

Feature	Description
🔌 Plugin Connectors	Fetch + transform exports from social platforms
🧠 Persona Layers	Style-of-speech profiles
🧾 Log Integration	Daily summary ingestion (via journaling or sensors)
📷 Media Hooks	Pull EXIF + alt text for memory support from images
🪄 LLM Enhancements	Use LLMs to auto-expand or clean up triplets
🔐 Local Mode	Offline use on AAC device (e.g. SQLite or DuckDB)

✅ Next Actions

Would you like me to:
	•	Generate a sample .md file and triplet .json based on your LinkedIn/family data?
	•	Write the Python md_to_triplets.py and triplets_to_graph.py scripts?
	•	Help structure the SQLite or RDF format for use in an actual AAC app?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.
